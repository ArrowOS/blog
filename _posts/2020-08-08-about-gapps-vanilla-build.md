<span class="Dropcap">H</span>ello, Ð°fter some  internal discussion, we decided to make GApps build with full-fledged built-in gapps. It includes Google Play services and now some AOSP apps have been replaced with Google apps. <br>So, as you know we have two types of builds <br><b>VANILLA</b> and <b>GAPPS</b>.

<span class="Dropcap">F</span>irst, a little bit about <b>VANILLA</b> builds. This are without GApps (clear AOSP). Ideal for those who like MicroG, wants to use without Google Apps or likes to use his own preferred GApps package.

<span class="Dropcap">S</span>econdly, I will inform you about <b>GAPPS</b> builds and the recent changes that will reflect on them from next weekly.

What it includes now and what are the changes, you ask?

These are the GApps thay will be shipped with GApps build now:

Google Play Services, core apps and Play Store
Google Dialer
Google Messaging
Google Contacts
Google Calculator
Google Calendar
Google Clock
Google Sound Picker
Device Personalization Services with Live Caption and etc.
Google Keyboard
Android System WebView

All similar AOSP apps have been overwritten with Google apps. You don't have to delete or freeze them manually.

All Google packages and another files extracted from original firmware images for Pixel 4XL (coral).

Why didn't we add more apps? You can install them yourself using play store. We want to give the user the maximum choice.

GAPPS builds are only available for devices with an official status.
