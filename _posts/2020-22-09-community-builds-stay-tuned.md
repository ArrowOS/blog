<span class="Dropcap">H</span>ello everyone, we're glad to inform you on one of our future project plans which will be going live soon. A new build variant under the tag <i>Community builds</i> will be rolling out soon for those devices which couldn't make into our official list. This variant's device sources are going to be solely maintained by its community maintainer/developer. Each one of them will be given access to our configs platform for their preliminary test builds. Further on certain intervals our jenkins will perform automated release builds for all the community devices to the public users.

#### Benefits
We see this as an oppurtunity for every budding developer/maintainer out there to sharpen their skills while learning and providing something to use for the device users. So, we welcome everyone that are interested, and those who were rejected earlier for official maintainership are free to re-apply. Every application will be verified and assigned a OFFICIAL/COMMUNITY tag for their device according to the applicants submitted details(device sources) and previous works if any.

More further details on the community edition builds advantages and changes/features will be announced at a later phase.

{% include svg-icon.html icon="terms-and-conditions" %}
ArrowOS or the CORE team will not be responsible in anyway for the management of device sources of community devices. No supervision will take place over the incidents/issues caused or responsible by community edition builds.

##### Be the community and Help the community grow.

#### Stay home, Stay safe!

#### Want to contribute? and one day earn a spot in the CORE team? <br>
