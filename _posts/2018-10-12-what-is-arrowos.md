With tons of custom roms available out there in Android Open-source community these days, where most of the users found to be using only a handful of features in daily life while bearing the extra loaded stuff unnecessarily. Before starting this project, the team members of ArrowOS were using a personalized aosp based rom with just few features and it turned out that its been liked by many of our close friends when we handed over this to them. Many of them suggested that why don' t we make as a ROM, so everyone can compile and use it. This is where ArrowOS began! with the sole goal of providing a stable custom rom without any heavy framework/UI customisations and trying to keep the performace to a full boost. Since then we have grown stronger with an ever supporting community of android enthusiasts and been trying to push out the most stable and feature balanced custom rom available so far.

## Installation

Installing ArrowOS on your devices is fairly simple and a straight forward process which you'll find on all our officially supported device specific threads on XDA along with any additional steps mentioned if needed.

Here are the common steps to be followed for most of the devices:

- Boot to your custom recovery(TWRP preferred).
- Head over to the Install option and choose your device zip package of ArrowOS.
- Go ahead flash the package and wait for the process to complete.
- Flash Gapps or any other other additional packages
- Reboot and you should be greeted with the ArrowOS homescreen if everything went well.

## Development

In order to start developing ArrowOS for your device you must be on a Linux environment and start by syncing our source code which can be done by running the following command in your terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir arrow
cd arrow
repo init -u https://github.com/ArrowOS/android_manifest.git -b arrow-9.x
repo sync  -f --force-sync --no-clone-bundle -jX
{% endhighlight %}
Where X in the above command is no.of threads your CPU can handle.
